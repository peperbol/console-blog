You can enter edit mech mode to add them to your mech and create crazy shapes and forms.  and resume driving arround while trying to not get out of balance. the heavier your mech, the higher your score. https://twitter.com/SileniStudios/status/834803497820422144"

The idea involves a map generator and he stumbled upon the fact that there doesn't exist a noise editor asset for Unity. So past week he started making one, which isn't finished yet. I will continue on improving it."
